This was a program designed to use reverse enumeration to find the probabily of finding yourself at a given node after having been through up to (n) other nodes. There is a visual representation of the graph I solved in /Ryland_A5/A5Graph.png


You can find a more detailed explanation of this project and my anaysis in /Ryland_A5/Bayesian.pdf
